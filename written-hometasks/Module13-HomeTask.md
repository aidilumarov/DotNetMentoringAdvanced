## Task 1 - Recommend software development model for the task in Module 2 (Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices). Argument how many teams and what team sizes are required to complete the task.

Given the nature of the tasks, an Agile development model would be suitable. Agile promotes iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Agile also encourages frequent communication and close collaboration between the business stakeholders and the development team, and it allows for changes in requirements as the project progresses.

For Task 1, a single team of around 3-5 members should be sufficient. This task seems to be relatively straightforward and doesn't appear to require a large team. The team should ideally consist of a mix of roles, including a developer, a tester, and a business analyst or a project manager.

The same thing is true for Task 2. A single team is required, which consists of 3-5 members with a mix of roles, including developers, testers, and a business analyst or a project manager.

Because there are two microservices to be developed, there must be two teams, each responsible for a single microservice. This will result in clear delineation of responsibilities and will promote ownership team efficacy. 

In terms of team structure, a cross-functional team where each member brings a different skill set would be beneficial. This allows for better collaboration and problem-solving, as team members can learn from each other and tackle issues from different perspectives.

## Task 2 - Provide and argument an estimation for the task in Module 2 (Monolith vs SOA vs Microservices), using one or combination of the estimation techniques of your choice (WBS technique is expected).

**Task 1: Carting Service**

1. Define Cart and Item entities - 4 hours
   - This involves defining the classes for the Cart and Item entities, including their properties and any data annotations for the NoSQL database. This is a relatively straightforward task, hence the lower estimate.

2. Setup and configure NoSQL database - 8 hours
   - This involves setting up the NoSQL database, configuring the connection in the application, and setting up the database context for Entity Framework. This can be a bit time-consuming, especially if there are any issues with the database setup or connection.

3. Implement DAL for Cart entity (CRUD operations) - 16 hours
   - This involves implementing the data access layer for the Cart entity, including methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting carts. This is a more complex task as it involves interacting with the database, hence the higher estimate.

4. Implement BLL for managing Cart operations - 16 hours
   - This involves implementing the business logic layer for managing cart operations. This includes validating business rules and calling the appropriate DAL methods. This is also a more complex task, hence the higher estimate.

5. Implement methods for getting, adding, and removing items in BLL - 16 hours
   - This involves implementing methods in the BLL for managing items in a cart. This includes methods for getting the list of items, adding an item to the cart, and removing an item from the cart. Each of these methods involves its own set of business rules and database operations, hence the higher estimate.

6. Unit testing for DAL and BLL - 16 hours
   - This involves writing unit tests for the DAL and BLL methods. This is an important task to ensure the correctness of the code, hence the higher estimate.

7. Integration testing and debugging - 8 hours
   - This involves testing the application as a whole, including the interaction between the BLL and DAL, and fixing any bugs that are found. This can be a bit time-consuming, especially if there are any complex bugs, hence the higher estimate.

Total estimate: 84 hours

**Task 2: Catalog Service**

1. Define Category and Item entities - 8 hours
   - Similar to Task 1, this involves defining the classes for the Category and Item entities. However, this task is a bit more complex due to the additional properties and relationships between entities, hence the higher estimate.

2. Setup and configure SQL database - 8 hours
   - Similar to Task 1, this involves setting up the SQL database and configuring the connection in the application. The estimate is the same as for Task 1.

3. Implement DAL for Category and Item entities (CRUD operations) - 24 hours
   - This involves implementing the data access layer for the Category and Item entities. This is a more complex task due to the additional entities and relationships, hence the higher estimate.

4. Implement BLL for managing Category and Item operations - 24 hours
   - This involves implementing the business logic layer for managing category and item operations. This is a more complex task due to the additional entities and operations, hence the higher estimate.

5. Implement methods for getting, listing, adding, updating, and deleting Categories and Items in BLL - 24 hours
   - This involves implementing methods in the BLL for managing categories and items. Each of these methods involves its own set of business rules and database operations, hence the higher estimate.

6. Unit testing for DAL and BLL - 24 hours
   - Similar to Task 1, this involves writing unit tests for the DAL and BLL methods. The estimate is higher due to the additional entities and operations.

7. Integration testing and debugging - 16 hours
   - Similar to Task 1, this involves testing the application as a whole and fixing any bugs. The estimate is the same as for Task 1.

Total estimate: 128 hours

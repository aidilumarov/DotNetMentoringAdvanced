1. **What Is SDLC? How many steps does it have? What are the tasks performed in Coding phase?**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. It consists of several phases: Requirement gathering and analysis, Design, Implementation or coding, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. In the coding phase, developers start building the software by writing code according to the design document and the requirements analyzed.

2. **Why agile models are so popular? Will you consider using waterfall nowadays?**

Agile models are popular because they promote flexibility, continuous improvement, and high customer satisfaction. Agile allows for changes in project requirements and focuses on delivering a working product quickly. While the Waterfall model is less popular due to its rigid structure and difficulty handling changes, it can still be useful for small projects with well-defined requirements and little to no change expected. Also, Waterfall might be necessary in large enterprises or government projects where strict requirements are in place.

3. **When will you choose to follow SCRUM and when KANBAN?**

SCRUM is suitable for projects with rapidly changing or highly emergent requirements. It has predefined roles and rituals and works well when a cross-functional team is dedicated to the project. KANBAN is great for maintenance projects or operations where there are incoming tasks that vary in priority and size. It's also useful when you have a steady flow of new work items added to your list and completed regularly.

4. **What are the options of scaling agile models? Does your project already follow a specific one?**

There are several frameworks for scaling Agile like SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), LeSS (Large Scale Scrum), and Nexus. These frameworks provide practices and guidelines for scaling Agile beyond a single team. The choice depends on the organization's size, culture, and specific needs.

5. **Why do we need to measure KPI of development models? How can we use them?**

KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) help measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the development process. They can provide insights into the quality of the software, the productivity of the team, the satisfaction of the customer, and the overall health of the project. By tracking KPIs, teams can identify issues early and make necessary adjustments.

6. **Please name estimation techniques you use on your current project.**

Estimation techniques can vary from project to project. Some common ones include Planning Poker, T-Shirt Sizes, The Bucket System, or simply time-based estimates.

7. **Which estimation techniques can be used for high level estimations?**

For high-level estimations, techniques like T-Shirt Sizes (Small, Medium, Large) or the Bucket System can be used. These techniques are less precise but require less effort and are suitable for a high-level overview.

8. **Which estimation techniques can be used for detailed estimations?**

Combination of Planning Poker and Expert Judgement.

9. **What are the risks related to the wrong estimations? Which is worse: underestimate or overestimate?**

Wrong estimations can lead to missed deadlines, increased costs, poor quality, and customer dissatisfaction. Both underestimation and overestimation have their risks. Underestimation can lead to stress, overtime, and burnout. Overestimation can lead to wasted resources or an inflated project timeline.

10. **Is it possible to convert story points into man-hours?**

While it's technically possible to convert story points into man-hours, it's generally discouraged. Story points and man-hours measure different things. Story points measure the complexity of the task, while man-hours measure the time it takes to complete the task. Converting between the two can lead to misunderstandings and inaccuracies.

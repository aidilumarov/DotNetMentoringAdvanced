## Explain the difference between terms: REST and RESTful. What are the six constraints?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A service based on REST is called a RESTful service. The six constraints of REST are Client-Server, Stateless, Cacheable, Uniform Interface, Layered System, and Code-On-Demand (optional).

## HTTP Request Methods (the difference) and HTTP Response codes. What is idempotency?Â  Is HTTP the only protocol supported by the REST?

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. GET retrieves data, POST sends data, PUT updates data, DELETE removes data, etc. HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 2xx is for success, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors, etc. An operation is idempotent if making the same request multiple times results in the same state. For example, DELETE is idempotent because deleting the same resource twice is the same as deleting it once. REST is bound to HTTP because it depends on the usage of HTTP verbs.

## What are the advantages of statelessness in RESTful services?

Statelessness in RESTful services means that the server does not keep any client state between requests. This simplifies the server design, allows scalability and improves reliability.

## How can caching be organized in RESTful services?

Caching can be implemented in RESTful services by using HTTP headers to control caching behavior.

## How can versioning be organized in RESTful services?

Versioning can be implemented in various ways such as URI versioning, query parameter versioning, or header versioning.

## What are the best practices of resource naming?

Best practices include using nouns (not verbs), using plural forms, using hyphens to improve readability, and using lowercase letters.

## What are OpenAPI and Swagger? What implementations/libraries for .NET exist? When would you prefer to generate API docs automatically and when manually?

OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs. Swagger is a set of tools that support the OpenAPI ecosystem, including tools for documentation, code generation, and testing. For .NET, there's Swashbuckle.

## What is OData? When will you choose to follow it and when not?

OData, or Open Data Protocol, is an open standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It allows clients to query and manipulate data using standard HTTP protocols. OData APIs expose a data model that describes the schema of the data, and allows clients to perform CRUD operations on the data.

When to use OData:

Complex Queries: OData shines when you need to provide complex querying capabilities to your clients. It allows clients to filter, sort, and paginate data directly from the URL.

Standardization: If you want to adhere to a standard that provides guidelines for CRUD operations and querying, OData is a good choice.

Interoperability: OData is platform-agnostic and can be used with any technology that supports REST and HTTP.

When not to use OData:

Simplicity: If your API is simple and doesn't require complex querying capabilities, using OData might be overkill.

Control: If you need to have full control over your API endpoints and how clients interact with your data, OData might not be the best choice as it allows clients to construct their own queries.

Performance: OData's flexibility can lead to performance issues. Since clients can construct their own queries, they can potentially create very complex queries that could impact performance.

## What is Richardson Maturity Model? Is it always a good idea to reach the 3rd level of maturity?

It's a model that grades your API according to the constraints of REST. Level 3 (HATEOAS) is not always necessary and can add complexity.

## What does pros and cons REST have in comparison with other web API types?

REST is simple, stateless, and can use HTTP caching mechanisms. However, it may not be suitable for real-time applications or for use cases that require maintaining state or a persistent connection.
